What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Empty git repository is initialized. Needs to be done in order to be able to track the files in the first place.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	It is an intermediate step between working directory and commit. It allows you to have more control over what you want to commit, e.g. only some of the files instead of all of them at once.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	By using git diff command to compare staging area and the most recent commit, or the working directory.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	When I want to make some "significantly" different feature in the code, which is somewhat separate from the master code, e.g., 
	own branch for MILP optimization when master branch is LP. This helps again with the fact that I don't need to save different versions of the code.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	
	By clearly showing the reachability of different commits, and the point in time where different branches were initialized.
