When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  At least when the project in question involves other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If I'm working on a project separately, changes made by other people might not be something that I want to see automatically updated in my own local repository.
